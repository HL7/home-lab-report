This is an example of a profile that is based on a framework profile and futher constrained to meet the requirements of the COVID-19 use case. It is based on the [Observation - At-Home In-Vitro Test Result](StructureDefinition-Observation-at-home-in-vitro-test-result.html) profile. 

It constrains the following elements to COVID-19 specific value sets:
* Observation.code - consult [LIVD](https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dls/livd-codes.html) to obtain the values to be used for each particular use case
* Observation.value - consult [LIVD](https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dls/livd-codes.html) to obtain the values to be used for each particular use case
