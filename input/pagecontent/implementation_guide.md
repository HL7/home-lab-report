### Implementation Guide Overview

This At-Home In-Vitro Test Implementation Guide creates a common framework (e.g. FHIR resources, FHIR value sets, etc.) that will be leveraged by multiple condition-specific At-Home In-Vitro Test use cases. The framework artifacts included in this guide are intended to be use case independent.

### Framework Profiles

Rather than creating multiple condition-specific profiles that only differ by value set binding for each type of At-Home In-Vitro Test type, this IG contains a set of [framework profiles](artifacts.html#profiles-at-home-in-vitro-test-report-framework) which conform to US Core Profiles (where available) with At-Home In-Vitro specific constraints and/or extensions. Some of the framework profiles are intended to be used as-is and some are intended to be used as a base with further constraints, mainly bindings to condition-specific value sets. Each profile contains information about which type they are and which elements are expected to be further constrained for a specific use case.

There is a set of [COVID-19 use case profiles](artifacts.html#profiles-covid-19-at-home-in-vitro-test-report) which should act as guidance for implementation of different use cases. These profiles have been instantiated in the [example instances](artifacts.html#examples-covid-19-at-home-in-vitro-test-report) included in the guide.

### Underlying Specifications

This guide is based on the [HL7 FHIR]({{site.data.fhir.path}}index.html) standard and the [US Core IG](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/index.html) specification, which builds additional capabilities on top of FHIR.  This IG is intended to maximize the number of systems that can conform to this guide as well as to allow for easy growth and extensibility of system capabilities in the future.

Implementers of this specification must understand some basic information about the underlying specifications listed above.

#### FHIR

This IG uses terminology, notations and design principles that are specific to the HL7 FHIR standard. Before reading this implementation guide, it is important to be familiar with the basic principles of FHIR and how to read FHIR specifications. Readers who are unfamiliar with FHIR are encouraged to review the following prior to reading the rest of this implementation guide.

* [FHIR overview]({{site.data.fhir.path}}overview.html)
* [Developer's introduction]({{site.data.fhir.path}}overview-dev.html) (or [Clinical introduction]({{site.data.fhir.path}}overview-clinical.html))
* [FHIR data types]({{site.data.fhir.path}}datatypes.html)
* [Using codes]({{site.data.fhir.path}}terminologies.html)

* [How to read resource & profile definitions]({{site.data.fhir.path}}formats.html)
* [Base resource]({{site.data.fhir.path}}resource.html)

This implementation guide is based on R4Â version of the HL7 FHIR Standard.
