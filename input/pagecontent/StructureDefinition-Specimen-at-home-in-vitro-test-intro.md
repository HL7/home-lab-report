This is a framework profile and can be the base of another profile that is further constrained to meet the requirements of a specific use case. See [Specimen - At-Home In-Vitro Test - COVID-19](StructureDefinition-Specimen-at-home-in-vitro-test-covid.html) for an example of such a profile.

The following element is expected to be constrained to a use case specific value set:
* Specimen.type - value set containing the use case specific specimen types (consult [LIVD](https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dls/livd-codes.html) to obtain the values to be used for each particular use case)
