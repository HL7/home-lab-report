We would especially appreciate comments on the following items:

1. Device.udi.carrier
2. Device.expirationDate
3. Device.lotNumber
4. Device.serialNumber
5. Device.deviceName
6. DiagnosticReport.media
7. Patient county is a required field in the V2 specification, in US Core Patient, Patient.address.district (county) is not specifically called out. Is it worth creating a new profile for this IG that is based on US Core, in order to require county?
