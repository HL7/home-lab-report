This is a framework profile and can be the base of another profile that is further constrained to meet the requirements of a specific use case. See [Observation - At-Home In-Vitro Test Result - COVID-19](StructureDefinition-Observation-at-home-in-vitro-test-result-covid.html) for an example of such a profile. 

The following elements are expected to be constrained to use case specific value sets:
* Observation.code - value set containing the use case specific test types (consult [LIVD](https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dls/livd-codes.html) to obtain the values to be used for each particular use case)
* Observation.value - value set containing the use case specific test results (consult [LIVD](https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dls/livd-codes.html) to obtain the values to be used for each particular use case)
* For Multiplex Assay tests that serve as a single test to diagnose infection caused by multiple viruses (e.g. CDC Flu SC2 Multiplex Assay for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, and/or influenza B viruses) use Observation.hasMember to reference another Observation - At-Home In-Vitro Test Result.
