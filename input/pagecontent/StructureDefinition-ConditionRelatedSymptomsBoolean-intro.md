This **Symptoms Present or Absent Profile** is a constraint on the [FHIR Observation Resource](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/observation.html) to represent a simple an "Ask on Order Entry" like question representing if Covid related symptoms are present, absent or unknown. This profile will be referenced from the [Covid At Home FHIR Diagnostic Report for a Covid Laboratory Result](https://fhir.org/fhir/us/home-lab-report/StructureDefinition/DiagRepHomeCovid) using the SupportingInformation Extension. In the home Covid testing use case the patient is asked this question when uploading, scanning or otherwise interacting with the Covid testing at home supporting App.
