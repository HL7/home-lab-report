This **Symptom Onset Date/Time Profile** is a constraint on the [FHIR Observation Resource](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/observation.html) to represent a simple an "Ask on Order Entry" like question representing the date and time the patient first noticed Covid related symptoms. This profile will be referenced from the [Covid At Home FHIR Diagnostic Report for a Covid Laboratory Result](http://homeCovid.com/fhir/structuredefinition/DiagRepHomeCovid) using the SupportingInformation Extension. In the home covid testing use case the patient is asked this question when uploading, scanning or otherwise interacting with the Covid testing at home supporting App.
