Although most at home test kits will have a single udiCarrier.deviceIdentifier for the "test kit" (all in one package of reagents, test card/device, etc.) it is possible for at home kits to have a resuable "reader device" which would need a distinct "equipment id". In this case, the reader device would have an "equipment UID" that may be the same for multiple tests performed. For these cases use multiple Devices - one to represent the test kit (which would have the Test Kit Name ID recorded in Device.udiCarrier.deviceIdentifier) and one to represent the reader device (which would have the Equipment ID recorded in Device.udiCarrier.deviceIdentifier).
