This is a framework profile and can be the base of another profile that is further constrained to meet the requirements of a specific use case. See [Device - At-Home In-Vitro Test - COVID-19](StructureDefinition-Device-at-home-in-vitro-test-covid.html) for an example of such a profile.

The data elements in this profile contain narrative guidance (mappings) to specific columns in the "LOINC Mapping" tab contained in the LIVD Spreadsheet.
