### RESTful FHIR Interactions Quick Start Guidance
Please see [US Core Quick start](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-observation-lab.html#quick-start) for an overview of search and read operations for this profile.

### SMART App Launch
Please see [SMART App Launche](http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/smart-app-launch/) for guidance around SMART apps including IDs.
This flow is not the same as an App that integrates with an EHR - so the sequence diagram is likely simpler.
#### App ID
The ClientID is typically the App ID when using SMART in FHIR App Launch. It is often a guid. 
This project needs to determine if a guid will be used/assigned for the App(s) involved in the interaction or a format based on ID construction heuristics.
The project will also explore if the App ID (ClientID) should also be sent within the profile message itself. This is not typically done within the resource itself - but could be replicated within the [meta.source](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/resource.html#Meta) available in the base resource. Care would need to be taken the the ClientID (App ID) in the SMART Launch workflow fields and the ID in the meta.versionID fields do not conflict.

### Extended Operations on the RESTful API
Please see [Extended Operations on the RESTful API ofr](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/operations.html) for guidance on a set of common interactions (read, update, search, etc.) performed on a repository of typed resources. These interactions follow the RESTful paradigm of managing state by Create/Read/Update/Delete actions on a set of identified resources.

### FHIR Bundle Resource
Given that with the home Covid Test use case exists of a single test, or series of independantly run tests by a patient, and resulted from a "Lateral Flow Assay" device and collected and/or sent by an App, there is no data base such as an EHR has where referenced resources can be queried for and returned.  As such any resource representing the lab result itself, "ask at "order" (AOE) answers, etc. will need to be packaged together into a bundle resource. The primary "bundling" function for this use case is for "Sending a set of resources as part of a message exchange (see [Messaging](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/messaging.html))"

Please see [Resource Bundle](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/bundle.html) for detailed Instructions.
