### Getting Started

[RADx® MARS (Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics – Modular Approach to Rapid Surveillance)](https://www.nibib.nih.gov/covid-19/radx-tech-program/mars) is an initiative aimed at providing guidance and resources for laboratories and healthcare facilities to rapidly implement and scale COVID-19 testing capabilities. One component of the RADx® MARS program is focused on HL7 version 2 (HL7v2) messaging, a widely used standard for healthcare data exchange.

[The "Getting Started: HL7v2" guide](https://www.nibib.nih.gov/covid-19/radx-tech-program/mars/hl7v2-getting-started) under RADx® MARS offers comprehensive instructions and support for laboratories and healthcare organizations seeking to implement HL7v2 messaging for COVID-19 testing. This guide provides step-by-step instructions, best practices, and resources for establishing HL7v2 interfaces between laboratory information systems (LIS), electronic health record (EHR) systems, and other healthcare systems.

Key components of the guide include:

**Introduction to HL7v2:** An overview of HL7v2 messaging standards, including message types, segments, and message transport mechanisms.
**[Implementation Guidance](https://www.nibib.nih.gov/covid-19/radx-tech-program/mars/HL7v2-implementation-guide):**  Detailed instructions on how to configure HL7v2 interfaces for COVID-19 testing, including message formats, segment definitions, Patient-specific fields, Sender-specific fields, Test-specific fields, Receiver-specific fields and sample message templates.
**Testing and Validation:** Recommendations for testing HL7v2 interfaces to ensure data accuracy, message integrity, and system interoperability.
**Troubleshooting and Support:** Resources and troubleshooting tips for addressing common challenges and issues encountered during HL7v2 implementation.
