# APPROVED by HL7 Cross Group Projects WG: Jira issue: https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-37619
WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/home-lab-report/StructureDefinition/Device-at-home-in-vitro-test').baseDefinition: US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Device derive from the core US profile. See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CGP/US+Core+Variance+Request+Process

# This profile IS based on a US Core profile - the US Core Survey profile - which exists in the latest published version of US Core - looks like the IG Publisher is checking a non-published version of US Core because in the ballot version the US Core Survey profile has been "Superseded by US Core Observation Screening Assessment Profile in version 6.0.0" and obviously we can't use a non-published profile
